# GuessWhoProject
Guess Who Project:
Origonally created as a High School Project in my Computer Science Class, I have designed and developed a Guess Who Simulator, where you play against time to guess who the secret character is. You will be presented with 25 characters, and your goal is to ask questions that will lead you to the secret character. Based on your answer, the program will block out the characters who meet the criteria for your question. For example, if you ask if the secret character has a blue beak, all the characters with a blue beak will be blocked out. Time is on a restraint, so try to find the character in time. There is a twist. There are powerups that aid you in various things. However, the character providing the powerups is sneaky, and will disadvantage you at times.
